# Mystery-Vault
âž¡ A steganography based website to ***encrypt*** messages, photos, video into each other with range of algorithmic options available for the task. <br/>
âž¡ Keep your secret message and authorise it with your password and reveal the scret message or photo or video by ***decrypting*** the message.<br/>

## Algorithm Used: Stanford Javascript Crypto Library Algorithm
- SJCL is secure & uses the industry-standard AES algorithm at 128, 192 or 256 bits
- Uses the SHA256 hash function; the HMAC authentication code; the PBKDF2 password strengthener; and the CCM and OCB authenticated-encryption modes.
- SJCL strengthens your passwords by a factor of 1000 and salts them to protect against rainbow tables, and it authenticates every message it sends to prevent it from being modified.
- SJCL provides the best security which is practically available in Javascript.
- SJCL is cross-browser.
- SJCL is open. Anyone can use, modify and redistribute it under a BSD license or under the GNU GPL, version 2.0 or higher.
- SJCL also supports ECC: elliptic curve cryptography (ECDH public key encryption and ECDSA signatures).
- Unforunately, this is not as great as in desktop applications because it is not feasible to completely protect against code injection, malicious servers and side-channel attacks.
